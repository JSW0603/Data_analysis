    "This brings us to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which category has the highest share of (active) apps in the market?\n",
    "- Is any specific category dominating the market?\n",
    "- Which categories have the fewest number of apps?\n",

    "We will see that there are 33 unique app categories present in our dataset. Family and Game apps have the highest market prevalence. Interestingly, Tools, Business and Medical apps are also at the top."
